        <h1>My Croissant</h1>
        <p>
            Making croissants is a labor of love. The long recipe directions and all these step-by-step photographs seem
            intimidating, but let me walk you through the basic process so you aren’t nervous.

            The Process
            make easy dough from butter, flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and milk
            roll out dough into a large rectangle
            make the butter layer (I have an easy trick for this!!!)
            enclose the butter layer inside the dough
            roll out the dough into another large rectangle, then fold it back together
            roll out the dough again, fold it back together again
            roll out the dough one more time, fold it back together
            shape the croissants
            bake
            There’s resting time between most steps, which means most of the time is hands off. To help us develop all
            the layers,
            croissant dough needs to rest in the refrigerator often. That’s why I call making croissants a project. Do
            it over a
            couple days with long breaks between the steps.

            All that rolling out and folding back together? That’s called LAMINATING.

            What is Laminated Dough?
            Laminating dough is the process of folding butter into dough many times, which creates multiple alternating
            layers of
            butter and dough. When the laminated dough bakes, the butter melts and creates steam. This steam lifts the
            layers apart,
            leaving us with dozens of flaky airy buttery layers.

            Just like we do when we make a croissant bread loaf, We’re going to laminate the dough 3 times, which will
            create 81
            layers in our croissants. Yes, 81! Let me paint that picture for you.

            Start with dough, butter layer, dough = 3 layers
            Roll it out and fold it into thirds = 9 layers
            Roll that out and fold it into thirds = 27 layers
            Roll that out one last time and fold it into thirds = 81 layers
            So we’re only laminating the dough 3 times, but that gives us 81 layers. When the croissants are rolled up
            and shaped,
            that’s one 81 layer dough rolled up many times. So when you bite into a croissant, you’re literally biting
            into hundreds
            of layers.

            Isn’t that SO COOL???
